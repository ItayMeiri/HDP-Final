This project used a significant amount of LLMs tools for various reasons and abilities:

1. Grammarly
Grammarly was used for the report to correct grammar usage, rewriting, etc. 


2. Co-pilot(built in IDE) - Edit mode for code refactoring, bug-fixing, etc. Ask mode was used for clarifications, quick questions and small code assistance. Agent mode was not used. 

3. Gemini + ChatGPT - both were used for assistance in writing and structuring the report, finding citations, etc. 
Additionally, these tools were used to throw ideas back and forth about the project, discuss analysis results, implement new analysis, etc. 

Some examples could be seen here:

Note - not all responses were used, many were changed by me, or co-pilot later, based on my needs for the project. 


Further usage:
* Help with citations for the report
* Refactoring errors
* Code refactoring into components


4. In-build overleaf AI tools for LaTeX assistance - i.e package to include, table organization, error solving, etc. 


All outputs from LLMs was, to the best of my ability, verified and checked multiple times.
